# Go Learning

## Chapter 01 - Tutorial

- GO has a lot of standard libraries and that's incredible
- I could read and make some rich examples, as an web server, client http with a methods
- Some aspects are confuse for me:
  - Pointers, of course
  - Method returns with more than one variable: resp, err := someMethod
  - Package declaration for different programs in the exercises (vs code show some warnings)
